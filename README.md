# Files-exceptional-handling-logging-and-memory-management
In Python, files are used to store and retrieve data on disk, allowing programs to read from or write to persistent storage. Exception handling provides a way to manage runtime errors gracefully using try, except, else, and finally blocks, ensuring the program doesn’t crash unexpectedly. Logging is used to record events, errors, and important messages, helping developers monitor the program’s flow and debug issues efficiently. Memory management in Python is handled automatically by the garbage collector, which allocates and frees memory as needed to optimize performance and prevent memory leaks.
